            Music as Homegrown Vegetables

                    &emsp;&emsp;My favorite music is music that feels like homegrown vegetables. To me, that can mean anything that sounds naturally organic and full of love. The expedition towards life that seeds embark on to fully sprout into a plant is such a beautiful and inspiring journey that I think humans need to appreciate more. The process of sowing seeds and blessing them with your love in order to watch them grow into a vegetable is a magical thing. Growing your own plants adds a level of appreciation and deep connection to life, so the ultimate goal for my own music is to create a pleasantly homegrown and sweet experience. I feel that the emotions humans derive from the process of growing vegetables from seeds should be similar to the emotions humans experience during the creation and consumption of music. I would like to collaborate and interact with other people to make music that feels alive and lovely. Along with my music, I would like to have a demeanor that inspires others to also spread love to their peers, animals, and to nature. However, I feel like I am still fairly early on in my musical journey, and will always be in the process of fully developing my style.

                    &emsp;&emsp;Since I began to play the bass almost four years ago, I find myself constantly discovering new things to think about musically. Whenever I hear others playing I feel like I can always pick out something that I really enjoyed and that I would want to incorporate into my own style. While I do worry that I will never fully be satisfied with my style and the process of development that goes along with it, I think that it is important to let go of the mindset of having to find your voice. It does not make sense to me to try and consciously innovate on music that I still feel like I am still scratching the surface of discovering. Because of this, I will continue to take advantage of the opportunities I have, such as education, my own instrument, and support from friends, family and nature, and I will try to learn and absorb as much as I can about everything in order to hopefully one day cultivate an individual style.

                    &emsp;&emsp;In order to work on my development as an individual and musician I like to spend time listening to other people playing, in both live settings and recordings, and look at nature. I also find it very helpful to think about nature and plants in comparison to music. I’ve found that when I feel down or disillusioned about my own playing I can use the energy of plants to feel more content and excited about creating music. This helps me develop my artistic vision and playing style, because although I find it important to be in touch with all emotions, I find it really hard to create when I am feeling negatively about life.

                    &emsp;&emsp;I was watching a video about the history and growing of chickpeas, my favorite legume and a big inspiration for my playing, and I learned that there are not just one, but many different variations of chickpeas that exist. I feel like chickpeas are a common and well known plant, so to discover all these new things about the species opened my eyes to the endless possibilities for life that nature allows. I think that this is a good way to think about music because when I may feel stuck and at a loss of artistic ideas, I can think about the many variations and types of chickpea plants with both subtle and extreme differences, and realize that there are so many different options to produce beautiful things from the same ingredients.

                    &emsp;&emsp;For tropical plants, such as the string of turtles plants, it can be hard to survive in all climates. They need a lot of love and nurturing to live somewhere other than their natural wild habitat. But people spend the time to give them as much turtle love so that they can survive and witness the magic that the turtle spirit brings to the world. Music is very personal for people in different ways. It can provide comfort to people who need to be comforted, as if they were a turtle plant in search for an environment to be content in. This could help me develop my playing style because I would like to think of music as a possible route to help people escape to for a while so that they may feel naturally more adjusted to the extremities that life can bring.

                    &emsp;&emsp;In forests, most trees have other trees that function as their friends, helping them survive in the forest and supporting one another until after they pass away. Trees have communities that support each other. Music creates communities of people whenever it is shared. This is inspiring to me for the development of my live concert playing style because I like to envision every concert as a new forest of people, including the performers and the audience, and everyone listening is listening with their brains, or their roots, to feel connected with each other as the music is shared. I also think that in order to help me achieve my ultimate goals within my artistic vision, it is important to think of my relationship with my bass as if we were tree friends. When I think about Fava, my bass, and I in this way I feel a much stronger connection between us and I also feel more comfortable trying to create sound from him.

                    &emsp;&emsp;To think about harmony and notes as soil has also been beneficial to me. Nowadays there are many different soils, or mediums, that are in stores for different types of plants, such as potting soil, cactus soil, and soils that go with flowers like orchids. While all of these soils may have specific benefits that make growing certain plants in them easier, I believe that the most important part of helping plants sprout and grow is to give them love and support and care. If I think about harmony as soil, and I’m thinking about growing ideas in that harmony, it brings me to really think about every note I place and to try my best to love and support all of the harmony rather than think about all of the notes as having to fit within a certain box of soil.

                    &emsp;&emsp;Another goal of my artistic vision is to inspire joy and strength in others. Although I do love enjoying music on my own and thinking about it, I would never be able to enjoy as much as I do without the shared love within my communities for music. I find it very important to interact with others and to make sure that everyone is feeling okay, and if they are not, to try my best to share something to lift their spirits. Similarly to how I want music to feel like homegrown vegetables, I want to have a lovely and comforting demeanor that encourages people to spread love, like we are all a giant Redwood forest. I want to put a lot of care into making sure that people understand my music in some way and I feel that having an all-natural and plant based demeanor will encourage people to be more open about art and listening to anything that I come up with to share, whether it be music or words.

                    &emsp;&emsp;Something that I hope to achieve is to become a well-rounded musician. I would like to be comfortable playing in different styles and be able to support other people as much as I can. In order to do this I plan on spending as much time as I possibly can with people who I look up to who I feel have done amazing things with their music. I want to take inspiration from them and try my best to continue the growth of the music that has been formed for many years. The development of music in the world is very much like the propagation of succulents. The mother succulent can provide leaves that grow into new succulents. No matter how far you go with the propagation of leaves into new baby succulents, there will always be the mother succulent that formed the basis for anything that grew from it.

                    &emsp;&emsp;Ultimately at this point, my goal is still to just absorb all the information I can to improve my playing and develop my voice in music naturally. I believe that the process of developing your own style should not be forced and if you really want to create a unique creative voice, it will occur naturally over time. It is important for me to keep in mind that music is a living artform that grows alongside the world, and that what I should stress the most over is not how to innovate, but how to join the journey of musicians everywhere to sow seeds in the rich soil provided by the past in hope of the success of new sprouts.
